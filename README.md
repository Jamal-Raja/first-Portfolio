# Personal Portfolio

This is my first personal portfolio website, built with **HTML, CSS, and JavaScript**.  
It showcases my skills, projects, and experience, and provides a way for people to get in touch with me.

👉 **Live Site:** [jamal-raja.github.io/first-Portfolio](https://jamal-raja.github.io/first-Portfolio/)

## ✨ Features

- **Responsive, mobile-first layout** – fluid typography and spacing tuned for phones, tablets, and desktops.
- **Sticky gradient header** – remains visible while scrolling; smooth-scroll links to **About**, **Projects**, and **Contact**.
- **Hero with clear CTA** – bold typographic logo (“Jamal Raja”), supporting strapline, and a primary **My work** button.
- **Diagonal section transitions** – angled dividers create clean visual breaks between sections.
- **Projects grid** – card layout with screenshots, short blurbs, and quick-action badges (e.g., **GitHub**, **Website**).
- **Dark theme + glassmorphism touches** – consistent purple palette with subtle depth on cards and the contact form.
- **Contact section** – simple form (name, email, message) plus a visible mail link.
- **Accessible colour contrast & focus** – high-contrast text on dark backgrounds; keyboard-navigable links and buttons.
- **Lightweight vanilla JS** – no frameworks; minimal JavaScript for navigation and UI polish.
- **Optimised assets** – SVG illustration and compressed images for faster load times.
- **Semantic HTML** – proper landmarks for header, main, sections, and footer to aid screen readers.
- **Footer with quick links** – repeated navigation for easy access at the end of the page.
